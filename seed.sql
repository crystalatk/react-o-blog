Maybe you do not own a dog that has a 35bpm heart rate so he will live forever. Maybe you should count yourself luck. When you and your husband have owned your dog since your husband was teenager, it feels like a very long time. But I digress. Senior Dog Barking. Usually happens at the worst times. During your favorite movie. During dinner. During business meetings. At 3 in the morning. When your instructor says, this is really important... And it isn''t just normal barking.

Don''t get sad about the deaf, that is how he has always been. And that has been fine. Until he decided that senoir barking was his favorite hobby.
